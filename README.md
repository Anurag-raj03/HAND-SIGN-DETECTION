# ✋🤚 Hand Sign Detection using OpenCV 🤚✋

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Hello everyone! 👋
I'm super excited to share my latest project — **Hand Sign Detection** 🤖✋ developed using **OpenCV**!
In this project, we detect popular hand gestures such as:

* **OK Sign**
* **Victory Sign**
* **Abuse Sign**
* **Little Hello Sign**

This project showcases how **Computer Vision** can be leveraged to recognize human gestures, which has applications in **automation**, **sign language translation**, **robotics**, and much more! 🚀

## 🖥️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Hand Segmentation

* Use **color thresholding** to isolate the hand from the background based on skin color.

### 2️⃣ Contour Detection

* Find the largest contour in the frame which is assumed to be the hand.

### 3️⃣ Convex Hull and Defects

* Analyze convexity defects to determine the hand gesture based on the number of fingers shown.

### 4️⃣ Gesture Recognition

* Based on the number and pattern of fingers detected, classify the sign as:

  * 👌 OK Sign
  * ✌️ Victory Sign
  * ✊ Abuse Sign
  * 👋 Little Hello Sign

## 📋 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-repo-link-here.git
   cd hand-sign-detection
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python hand_sign_detection.py
   ```

4. **Start showing hand signs** ✋ to your webcam and watch them get detected live! 🎥
